The Crude Viewer Amplifier (CVAmp) is a small GUI tool that spawns muted Google Chrome instances via [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python), each with a different HTTP proxy connection. Each instance navigates to the streaming channel and selects the lowest possible resolution.
