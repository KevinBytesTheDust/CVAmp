**Pro Version:** Full features, ready-to-use executable. Recommended!  
**Basic Version:** Basic Features for code review/modification.



1. Download the CVAmp_PRO_v*VersionNumber.zip for your OS from the \_Assets section* below.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder.
3. Provide your own private HTTP proxies to the [proxy_list.txt](proxy/proxy_list.txt) or follow our [Proxies Guide](https://github.com/KevinBytesTheDust/cvamp/wiki/Webshare.io-Proxies-Guide).  
Get 10 free proxies for testing and 10% off your first proxy purchase at [Webshare.io](https://blueloperlabs.ch/proxy/wf).  
4. Start executable and wait for GUI.
5. Spawn instances patiently.

If instances are dying or buffering too much, your system/bandwidth/proxy is struggling.
