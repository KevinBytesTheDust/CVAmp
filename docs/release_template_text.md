1. Download the CVAmp_VersionNumber.zip for your OS from the _Assets section_ below.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder.
3. Add your own proxies to proxy/proxy_list.txt.  
Buy trusted proxies [here](https://blueloperlabs.ch/proxy/wf) or follow the [Webshare.io Proxies Guide](https://github.com/KevinBytesTheDust/cvamp/wiki/Webshare.io-Proxies-Guide).
5. Start executable and wait for GUI.
6. Spawn instances patiently.

If instances are dying or buffering too much, your system/bandwidth/proxy is struggling.
